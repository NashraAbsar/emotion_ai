This project combines Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Data Encryption to build a smart emotion-aware system.
Users can input any text, and the system will:

Detect the emotional tone (e.g., joy, anger, sadness, surprise, etc.)

Encrypt the text securely

Save the results for future visualization

Decrypt and visualize emotions through an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Built using Python, Transformers, and Tkinter, this project demonstrates the power of AI and emotional intelligence in modern applications.
